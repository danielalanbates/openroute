# Status / handoff (2026-08-19)

## Verified
* luajit offline suite (`luajit tools/test_offline.lua`) passes end-to-end: parser, Dijkstra
  (hearth-first + cross-continent boat), precedence-safe StepOrder, SuggestNext (pick/exclude/refit),
  baked import (797 Zygor + 119 WoW-Pro), **guide-menu tree** (9 ordered categories, all 873 guides
  reachable when expanded, collapsed view clean, flat search).
* Earlier in-game rounds (see git log 66a6f55..140a03d): arrow, hearth button, quest-item button +
  cooldown, auto-complete, guide chaining, taxi handler, gear advisor, standalone baked guides,
  location-aware suggestion at login.

## Guide browser (new, 2026-08-19)
`/or guides` now shows a Zygor-style collapsible tree: Category (Leveling, Dungeons, Dailies, Gold,
Professions, Reputation, Achievements, Titles, ...) -> folder (Zygor's original folder path, or zone
for WoW-Pro/native) -> guide, with counts and level-sorted folders. Typing in the search box switches
to a flat level-sorted list. `/or switch` jumps straight to the suggested next guide.
Headless checks live at the end of tools/test_offline.lua via `NS.GuideMenu._test`.

## Testing tips
* WoW keystrokes via scratch type.py only after `lsappinfo front` == "Wow" (a mis-focused burst
  once typed into the terminal). `/or log` opens a copyable in-game log; Trade chat drowns prints.
* Battle.net launcher auto-logs-in (account solcus); WoW Classic favorite -> Burning Crusade
  Anniversary -> Play. Client loads from /Volumes/x10 and can take minutes to show a window.
* Install: `tools/install.sh` (bakes guides + rsyncs into _anniversary_ AddOns).
* Offline tests need luajit (lua5.4 lacks unpack); first run after iCloud eviction may need
  `cat OpenRoute/Guides/Imported_*.lua > /dev/null` to materialize the baked data.

## Next
1. In-game screenshot pass on the new tree menu (open `/or guides`, expand Leveling, load a guide).
2. More native guides (1-20 both factions).
3. Road/wall data for walking accuracy (docs/ROUTING.md).
4. Real-play-session polish items (arrow bearing at speed, item button timing).
